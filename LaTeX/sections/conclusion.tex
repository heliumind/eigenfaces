\section{Conclusion}

I have compared two methods of diagnostic feature generation in face
recognition. These include the linear PCA and nonlinear autoencoding approaches.
Both belong to unsupervised machine learning. The main advantage of
PCA is its simplicity and low cost of processing. The encoder is a multilayer
structure applying nonlinearity in signal processing. Its main advantage is
relatively higher insensitivity to the natural variability in the images forming
the same class and making it significantly robust to noise present in the images
forming the data base. 

The results of numerical experiments of face recognition using SVM and softmax
classifiers have proved the superiority of an autoencoding principle of feature
extraction. The variability of the values of discriminant features within the
same class is significantly smaller for autoencoding way of feature extraction.
This leads to higher efficiency of autoencoder generated features in face
recognition. As a result the average accuracy of classification is higher.
